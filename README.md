joern
====

joern is a tool for robust analysis of C/C++ code. It generates
abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and control flow graphs (CFGs) from
source code without the need for a working build environment. ASTs and
CFGs are stored in a Neo4J graph database. This allows code bases to
be searched using complex queries formulated in the graph traversal
languages Gremlin and Cypher.

The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/fabsx00/joern/wiki)
